- 👋 Hi, I’m @EzFeDezy
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, "secure" and telemetry-free IoT, and much more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github. I hope I'll learn a lot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Idk. My own projects I guess?  
- 📫 How to reach me ... Idk. Does Github have a private messaging system?
